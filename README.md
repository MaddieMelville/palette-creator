## Description

Do you want to create a color palette that matches an image from your website? Or maybe you just want to grab some colors for inspiration? Then this is the extension for you!

Just right click on the desired image, select the *Palette for Chrome* option, and choose the number of colors you want the palette to have.

A new tab will open, displaying the image and the resulting color palette. It's that easy!

PS: When installing *Palette for Chrome*, your browser will warn you that this extension can access your data on all sites, and your browsing history. These permissions are required to load and process images from any domain. No information is stored on your computer and no personal data is obtained from this extension. I promise!

PPS: *Palette for Chrome* doesn't depend on external services. All the processing is done inside your browser. That's why you may see a peak in CPU usage when working with big images.
